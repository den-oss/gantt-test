# gantt-test
Experimental running ExtJs app @ NodeJs

# Requirements
We have a page that runs Bryntum gantt over our information.
We want to test an option to run that page on a nodeJs server as a gantt engine.
As we see it we will need to solve several issue through this project, but first we want a prototype that:
1. Runs our uglifled solution on nodeJs Server.
2. We can access a page on that server that asks for login (user + password).
3. Shows a list of projects to select from (query over project object).
4. After selecting a project does the logic on the server side that whould have been done on client side and shows a loading sign until process is finsihed.
5. Shows a "save" button that on click does the "save" logic from our solution.

Simplified Requirements:
1. Runs our uglifled solution on nodeJs Server.
2. We can access a page on your server that has two inputs:
2.1. Token.
2.2. Project Id
3. The page will have two buttons:
3.1. load - does the logic on the server side that whould have been done on client side and shows a loading sign until process is finsihed - on finish shows how much time it took.
3.2. save - on click does the "save" logic from our solution.
